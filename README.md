# Time To Learn About Modules

It's Friday Junior, August 03, 2023, and I am learning some new aspets of the Python programming language. Up next are modules. This is part of Jose Portilla's Pyton boot camp course that I'm taking through Udemy. I'm 75% completed with the course.

This, what you're reading, is a coding journal. It's something that was suggested to do on various channels throughout the coding multiverse on the internet. It's kind of enjoyable, and it allows me to reflect on what I've learned and to manifest what my goals are as I continue to learn.

Learning Python is part of my eventual goal of becoming TensorFlow certified 363 days from now. There will be many challenges on this particular Odyssey, and, if I keep at it, I will without a doubt learn a lot about machine learning and data science in general.

My short term goal is to complete this Python boot camp before Monday, August 07, 2023. That's when my IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate program starts -- a 16-week course ending on November 16, 2023. According to the syllabus, the time requirement is 9-10 hours a week for this particular course. I plan to keep doing these journals throughout the IBM course, uploading work to repos here as appropriate. We'll see how it goes.

I have a very strong feeling of gratitude towards IBM and the VA for giving me this opportunity. Life has taught me to have zero expectations that anything good will happen in my life, but this seems good. I intend to show my gratitude by giving 100% of my effort and focus to this course. Using the skills and knowledge I develop to do good for my community in some way is another method in which I'll hopefully be able to thank the VA and IBM for this opportunity.

We're in the middle of a slow moving gold rush. I love that oxymoron, because on the surface data doesn't glitter. But data is the most valuable thing on the planet. And using it responsibly should be a priority. The journey I'm embarking upon to achieve my TensorFlow certification is a manifestation of my desire to be part of the effort to be in the know about machine learning and data science so that I can help influence its responsible use in any way that I am able. That was a very long sentence but I assure you that it was grammatically correct. Back to learning.
